# dotfiles
backup of configuration files

running `installdotfiles.sh`  will move all current dotfiles (specified in this project) to a folder on $HOME called old_dotfiles
Then installdotfiles will place symbolic links to the home directories dot files directing to the files in this directory


useful things to install:

zsh shell: https://ohmyz.sh/
    - nice shell with loads of custom themes and build in commands uses .zshrc and .zprofile
